# Extended Taxonomies #

Extended Taxonomies is a library which provides extended functionality to WordPress custom taxonomies, allowing developers to quickly build custom taxonomies without having to write the same code again and again.

This library has been merged into [Extended CPTs](https://github.com/johnbillion/extended-cpts). This repo is therefore abandoned and should not be used.
